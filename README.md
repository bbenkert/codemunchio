## About Codemunch.io

**Byte-sized learning for new developers**

The goal of Codemunch.io was to help new developers find clear, simple answers to the questions they often have when starting out. Many online resources are overly complex and fail to explain basic concepts in a way that makes sense. Codemunch.io aimed to fill that gap with beginner-friendly content.
