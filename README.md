This project has been permanently discontinued.

<p>Due to inactivity and other interests I have moved on from this project. It was super fun to build this project and it has inspired me to work on other things.</p>

Codemunch.io <br/> Byte sized learning for new developers
</h2>
<p>
CodeMunch.io's purpose is to help new developers answer some questions they have when first starting to code. Many resources on the web are over complicated and just dont answer the simple questions in a way that makes sense.
